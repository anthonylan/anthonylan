***Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by!***

I write software because it's rewarding and I genuinely love it. Honestly, if you ask me, doing what you love is the best reason to do anything.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open to new freelance projects and exploring my personal ventures, including:
- [Themes: Micro SaaS landing pages](https://themes.indiebold.com/)
- [Temaly: Time tracking app](https://temaly.com)

Have a big idea ðŸš€ or just want to say hello? Letâ€™s connect! ðŸ“«
